# What is this?
Saracakis S.A. is the main Greek Distributor of Honda & Mitsubishi parts and vehicles. He monthly sends pricelists for both brands to his dealers in an ancient DOS flat-file format (CP737 encoding).

This is a PHP library to parse these files in order to update a CRM or eCommerce platform. Currently only parts supported. If someone has a vehicle pricelist of the same format feel free to share.

## Installation 🔧

```sh
composer install php-saracakis-pricelists
```
